images through their service called `DALL-E` then you might have seen that you don't get exact thing you want in first cut... For that, you have to make few attempts or you have to enter prompt again and again so that you can pick `1` out of `10` generation...

And waiting and entering prompt again and again is kind a tedious process and you might get irritated doing so.
